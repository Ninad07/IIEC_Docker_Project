Hello Learners

I have created a docker compose file to manage the configuration, installation and running of Jenkins.
Jenkins is a DevOps tool that is an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.
It is a Web UI Application.
It is always better to use a persistent storage while using Jenkins.
So I have linked the Jenkins Image with MySQL Database Server to create a persistent storage.
But before using Jenkins, we require to configure it. My project solves the problem of configuring and installing it manually.

To use the YAML file:
1] Pull Jenkins and MySQL images from Docker Hub
2] Run the 'docker-compose up' command
3] This process begins to configure Jenkins. After a few minutes, Jenkins gets configured and installed.
4] After the installation, the process will prompt an authentication password for logging in to Jenkins.

# Jenkins must be installed on the top of Linux OS (in my case RedHat 8) and the application must be run through a remote OS (in my case Windows)
5] Enter the password and then you are good to go.

****UPDATE:
I have included the ngrok feature in the project.
This feature allows the users to expose their Jenkins Web application to the public world, without buying the public IP.
To use:
1] Instead of using the 8080 port while launching Jenkins, use the port number 4040
(As Ngrok works on port 8080)
2] A URL is prompted. Copy the URL.
2] The URL allows the users to access your Jenkins site publically.

Such kind of complex concepts were very easily explained to me by Vimal Daga Sir.
I thank Vimal sir from the depth of my heart for lauching the IIEC_Rise campaign. IT is really proving very beneficial to students like me.
Once again thank you very much Sir. We owe you a lot.
